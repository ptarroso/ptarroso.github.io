In this post I'm describing the process I used to create the Ptolemy 3D map. Although I have aimed this tutorial at a beginner level, it still hinges on GIS concepts and therefore some knowledge on geospatial data manipulation, as well as some familiarity with the blender interface, makes it easier to follow the instructions. All software I use for this tutorial is free and open source and works on most operating systems available.

Here is the final image we will be creating.

The source map for this is project is based on [Ptolemy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy) work and depicts the *Ecumene* or the known world during the 2nd century. It is centered on the Mediterranean, showing the European and African coasts with great detail. In fact, it is curious how well known this coastal area was at the time, compared to Northern Europe. The map summarizes geographical knowledge during the Roman Empire, so it does makes some sense they have accumulated detailed knowledge here. However, the Romans had already settled in England by this time, hence some geographical information was already available. The original map was part of the Ptolemy's [*Geographike Hyphegesis* or *Geographia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_(Ptolemy)) manuscript however none survived to these days. This work is no less than amazing: it provided a table of features (cities, mountains, etc) with coordinates based on latitude and longitude, from western Europe to Asia, and a treatise on how to produce maps with description of map projections. The coordinate system was based on latitude measured in degrees from the equator and longitude on the prime meridian placed in the Fortunate Islands (Canary Islands) which was the most western point known at the time.

Being the most accurate and exhaustive atlas at its time, at least within the Roman world, Ptolemy's work had a large influence on many cultures and set standards for cartography production. Although the manuscripts did not survive, many Latin and Arabic translations did. The map I use here is based on the [Jacobus Angelus's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacopo_d%27Angelo) Latin translation of Ptolemy's work (1406 AD). Perhaps new features were added and it stimulated the creation of new maps, but the known world to Europe did not change much until the 16th century.

# Preparing the data

The base map for this project can be found [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/PtolemyWorldMap.jpg). I have slightly edited the image in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to remove the background and the clips in the corners. I also did a small crop to adjust to the extent and used some sharpening. This map will be used as texture for the 3D object later. The final size of the image is 1500x1026px, which we will be using a lot to maintain proportions of the images we will be creating. You can find my file [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resources/PtolemyWorldMap.jpg).


For elevation data I have used the [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/) dataset. It combines both elevation and bathymetry data we need to produce the 3D. I downloaded the global GeoTiff sub-ice data file that is divided into several tiles. I merged the necessary tiles to have the extent from -30째 to 180째 of longitude and -50째 to 90째 of latitude. Since the full resolution and extent available is excessive for this project, I cropped and scaled it down to a more manageable file size. This can be done with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) or, if you have some command line skills, at the terminal with GDAL. With QGIS, just open the images and use **Raster->Miscellaneous->Merge** tool to merge the tiles to a single image. This may take a while as the images are very large. Note that decreasing the resolution before merging might generate some edge effects on each tile do to the lack of needed information of the neighboring tiles. Crop with **Raster->Extraction->Clip Raster by Extent** and use *-30,180,-50,90* in the extent field to reduce to the desired area of this project. Finally you can reduce the resolution. For that I have used the **Raster->Projections->Warp** tool. I set the resolution to *0.01* which is only a decrease by a factor of about 2 but it was enough to keep the processing going smoothly in my computer. I had some problems with this tool because it was resetting the longitude extent to -180/180 and creating a very large image. To avoid this, I have forced in the options to have the same extent as the clipped layer. So I set the *resampling method* to *average*, the *output resolution* to *0.01* and for the *georeferenced extents of the output file* parameter I used the original layer by using the dots icon on the right of the field.

# (De)georeferencing the map

The objective here is to overlay the elevation data with the Ptolemy's projection as accurately as possible. This includes heavy distortion and twists of the elevation data to fit the real geographic features into the known world map of Ptolemy. We can't rely on simple affine or polynomial transformation. We will have to use **thin plate splines** that allow the level of distortion we need. However, we will have to reference a lot of points to be able to succeed on this. I have used the **Raster->Georefencer** tool in QGIS. Open the Ptolemy's World map file in QGIS and the elevation model in the georeferencer tool. The intention is to create as many points as possible in the elevation map and give the corresponding point in the Ptolemy's World map. I have created 539 points around the identifiable features and, by trial and error, added/removed some in order to extend the elevation data over the whole map. I avoided point configurations that created heavy and visible stretches of the data, particularly on the bathymetry, that would affect the 3D. You can see the set of points I have used in the next figure and you can also [download]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resources/Ptolemy_georef.points) the file to directly import to your project. If you are using your own edited image of the Ptolemy's map, this set of points might be shifted and you will have to create your own.

After creating all the necessary points, simply use the **Thin Plate Spline** option and save to a new file. This map will serve as a displacement texture for the 3D in Blender. We won't need any coordinates for the 3D but we need to make sure that the images overlay correctly with the World map. For that you can use **Raster->Extraction->Clip By Extent** tool again and set the extent to the Ptolemy's World map to make sure it has the same proportions. Another thing that we need to get rid of is the elevation data... Blender does not read the numeric information associated with the pixel like the GIS, only the color intensity. This means that we have to convert the map to a typical image without real elevation data but with different shades of gray proportional to the elevation. We first choose a gradient from black to white in the symbology (I'm using a linear gradient but you can play with the gradient to highlight some features). We now have to export the image to a typical image file using QGIS. We can use for this the menu **Project->Import/Export->Export Map to Image**. In the popup window use the layer to define the extent and choose also the resolution to export (I used 600 dpi for this example).

# Prepare the elevation texture

After the GIS work done, now it is time to prepare textures for the 3D in a photo editing software. I have used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) again but you can use any other photo editing software (e.g. photoshop). The idea is to edit the elevation texture we produced above so that it fits perfectly with Ptolemy's map of the World. With the elevation image opened in GIMP, I added a new layer with the Ptolemy's map for guidance. Since it has lower resolution, it needs to be scaled to the full extent of the elevation and it should align with it. I created a few masks for the area where we should have elevation data and improvised a bit on the southern part (Terra Incognita) and in the islands at the western part to create land elevation. I have used the clone tool for most of this task. You can check the layers I have produced to get the final elevation texture map in the animation below.

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/20220629_ptolemy_edit.gif){: .align-center}

The animation highlight some of the details with arrows. There is a general land mask that was based on the Ptolemy's map to provide more detail and sharpen the land/water transitions, including the rivers. It is basically a land mask with rivers with a medium gray tone. I used the color pick on a known land area in the elevation map to select the gray intensity for land mask. With all layers active, export it to a png file. You can find the file I produced [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resources/PtolemyWorldMap_displace.png).


# Make the 3D map

Now we have everything ready to go to [Blender](http://www.blender.org). Since we have all images with the same proportions, we can easily create the 3D scene. Just open Blender and erase every thing in the default scene. Start by adding a simple plane and scale it to the size of the image. To avoid a very large mesh in the viewport, I set the scale to 15 x 10.26 m. I edited the plane and added two vertical edges and a horizontal one. This creates near-square subdivisions which results in a nicer 3D model. Then I moved to the modifiers panel and added a subdivision surface and set the subdivision algorithm to simple. This avoids smoothing the plane corners, maintaining the rectangular shape. To avoid huge lags displaying the mesh, I use a lower number of subdivision iterations (around 8) for the viewport but set render iterations to, at least, 10, for high detail in the final render. Next, I added a displace modifier which takes the elevation data and projects it to the mesh. Select a new image texture and open the file created above. You can tweak a bit the displacement options (strength and mid-level) to find the best settings for your. Now the object just needs the texture of the Ptolemy's map. In the texture panel, add a new texture, choose Image in the color selection and open the Ptolemy's World map image. The object is basically done. We just have to create a camera and lights to render the scene.

I prefer an orthographic camera for this scene, placed exactly above the map. Setting the export resolution to the same size of the image allows to adjust perfectly the camera to the map. In the orthographic scale, set the value to 15 (or adjust if the dimensions you are using are different). For the light, I prefer to use an environment texture with a HDRI image. It makes so easy to set excellent lighting for these maps. I have used the free and excellent [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) to get this [image](https://polyhaven.com/a/lenong_2). It creates dramatic shadows (perhaps a bit excessively...) and adds a warm tone to the map, which I like. In Blender, go to the World Proprieties panel, and set the color to Environment Texture and open this file.

You may now render the image (menu Render->Render Image or F12) and you should get a similar image to the one in the beginning of the post.


# Final considerations

I prepared this tutorial so that it could be followed by anyone, regardless of experience with any of the programs used. To achieve this, I have tried to simplify the entire process. For my [original map](https://twitter.com/ptarroso/status/1407396279039234052), I have used other strategies that included some programming in Python and R and I have used extensively the bash terminal for most of GIS and image exportation. This gave me full control of the maps and resolution. Also I have used images with higher resolution to produce the final 3D. It was basically the maximum resolution that I could work in my desktop computer without excessive stalling and errors. However, if you follow this tutorial you will still be able to produce very high quality maps!
